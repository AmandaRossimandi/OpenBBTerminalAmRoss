# Introduction to Cryptocurrency
The Cryptocurrency menu allows you to discover trending cryptocurrency [(disc)](https://openbb-finance.github.io/OpenBBTerminal/terminal/crypto/disc/). Additionally, you can also perform research of a specific coin [(dd)](https://openbb-finance.github.io/OpenBBTerminal/terminal/crypto/dd/), NFT [(nft)](https://openbb-finance.github.io/OpenBBTerminal/terminal/crypto/nft/) or most lucrative Defi project [(defi)](https://openbb-finance.github.io/OpenBBTerminal/terminal/crypto/defi/). It does so by handing you tools to (among other things) to perform technical analysis [(ta)](https://openbb-finance.github.io/OpenBBTerminal/terminal/crypto/ta/), quantitative analysis [(qa)](https://openbb-finance.github.io/OpenBBTerminal/terminal/crypto/ta/), and give you access to onchain information [(onchain)](https://openbb-finance.github.io/OpenBBTerminal/terminal/crypto/onchain/).


## How to use
The Cryptocurrency menu is called upon by typing `crypto` which opens the following menu:

You have the ability to search a coin with `find` based on its name or symbol. An example:

As a result, you can see a list of coins matching your search criteria. Once you identify the coin you are looking for, next step is to `load` it. See the example below:

To view the candle chart for the loaded crypto, you can call `candle`. This will show you the coin's historical prices and volume, as follows:

In case you want to adjust the default period, you can do so by specifying the number of days to go back in time.

You might be wondering, how can I know about all possible options? You can type in `command_name -h` or `load -h` in this case. Here you will find available optional arguments that you can play with.

Lastly, by calling `?` or `help` or `h`, the `crypto` menu will be re-populated. Here you can see that several menus have turned blue, which mean you can enter any of them now. In order to use these menus, you are required to first `load` a coin.
